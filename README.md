# CV Creator APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Structure
The project was created as a profile of a Full Stack Developer looking for his or her first job opportunity in the tech industry, who has extensive work experience in other fields and has decided to change career paths at a mature age.That's why the structure has more space for certain areas than others.
Names of institutions, companies, social network profiles, projects, and courses have links attached to them so that you can directly navigate them to find out more information.
